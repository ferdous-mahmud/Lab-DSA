# A Queue is a linear structure which follows FIFO in which the operations are performed.

# FIFO (First In First Out)

# Needy Variables:
	1.capacity - capacity of total list / array
	2.totalItem - currently have total item on list/array
	3.front - keep track of front item 
	4.rear - keep track of last item

# Operations on queue:
	1.enqueue() - add item on queue 
	2.dequeue() - remove item from queue and return it
	3.isEmpty() - check queue empty or not
	4.isFull() - check queue full or not


# Circular array on stack:
	for,
		 enqueue -> rear = (rear + 1) % capacity
		 dequeue -> front = (front + 1) % capacity
